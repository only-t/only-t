Hi, I'm T, creative I know.
I'm a programmer, part time Don't Starve Together modder and most importantly - a guy with too much free time.

From the very first line of code I ever wrote in primary school coding became my hobby.
From a simple start using Baltie and Scratch steadily expanding to C++, JavaScript, HTML and Python.

As a young adult, I am very interested in video games, especially non triple A, simple style, indie games such as:
Minecraft, Realm of The Mad God Exalt, The Binding of Isaac (even tho I haven't played it yet)...
And finally Don't Starve Together.

The latter being especially close to my heart as it was basically my childhood game and that's why when I discovered the modding scene of this gem,
I just had to try it myself. And this is when I got absolutely addicted to it.

Coding is my passion, and modding brings me a lot of joy.

In the future I'm planning to branch out into modding different games I really enjoy, as well as learn more JavaScript and HTML to better myself in back-end as well as front-end.
